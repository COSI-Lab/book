## What is a Mirror?

An open source mirror volunteers for open source projects, such as Ubuntu, to provide a geographically local copy of their data. This way, users of that project can receive faster, more efficient, downloads. All while providing less strain to the upstream project's limited resources. 

Mirrors were one of the first examples of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and they currently provide an important service to dozens of open source projects.

COSI is the maintainer of Clarkson's open source mirror. According to the [history](https://mirror.clarkson.edu/history) we've hosted a mirror, in some form, since October 2002. Currently the mission of our mirror is to service open source communities, spread recognition and appreciation of open source, and provide learning opportunities to it's maintainers.

Mirror could also play a role in Clarkson Research Reproducibility efforts by hosting public archives of research data.
