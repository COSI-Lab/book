# Servers

_updated: Sept 17th 2022_

This chapter contains an alphabetically ordered list of all of COSI's physical server. For our purposes a server is any computer that is mounted on a rack. Our servers are spread across the university colocation in Old Main (colo), SC 334-A (the server room), and the SC 252 (the second floor).
