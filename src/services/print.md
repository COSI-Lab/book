# Print

There is a job queue submission program running on <http://print.cslabs.clarkson.edu>. PDFs can be submitted via the web form which will then use CUPS to actually perform the job.

The system supports user accounts and page quotas but we don't believe in anything like that right now.

`csguest/cspassword` and be respectful of the paper waste.

The printer is known to occasionally emit smoke. This is considered normal.
