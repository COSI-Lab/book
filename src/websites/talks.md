# Talks

_updated: December 1st, 2023_

Talks is a web app that allows lab members to schedule topics for our weekly meetings. It can be accessed at <https://talks.cosi.clarkson.edu>.

Talks is currently hosted as a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container on [Tiamat](../infrastructure/servers/tiamat.md).

[go-talks](https://github.com/COSI-Lab/go-talks) is the latest of several rewrites of Talks. Its source code is located on the [COSI-Lab](https://github.com/COSI-Lab/) organization on github.

## Notes

Adding talks from outside the labs requires a password. If you still get the password prompt while in the labs, make sure you are connected to the right network (connections from the rest of the university are treated as external).
