_updated: December 6, 2023_

CSlabs (<https://cslabs.clarkson.edu>) is the homepage for Clarkson University's Applied Computer Science Labs.
It is currently hosted as a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container on [Tiamat](../infrastructure/servers/tiamat.md). Its source code is available at <https://github.com/COSI-Lab/cslabs>.

The CSlabs website contains general information about the applied CS labs, as well as pages specific to COSI, the ITL, and the VR lab. It also contains links to resources and services hosted by COSI, as well as a contact page for the CS department and the labs.
