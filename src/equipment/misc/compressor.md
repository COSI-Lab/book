# Compressor

The air compressor is stored beneath Steggo.

### When using it, keep the following safety items in mind:

- The compressor shuts off at ~135 PSI. *Tank pressure should never exceed 
140 PSI.*

- The tank MUST be completely emptied after each use, otherwise moisture will
build up and cause it to rust and fail catastrophically.

- The regulator must be completely closed (turned all the way left) to fill the
tank when it is completely depressurized. Otherwise, air will escape through it
and the motor may overheat.


### More compressor tips:

- The regulator should be set around 40 PSI. If it's set lower, the valve does
not close properly. If it's set higher, it will empty the tank very quickly.

- Use short bursts of air to keep pressure high - the tank fills slowly.


### Notes
Cleaning out servers and desktops should be done outside the labs in the interest of not spraying dust everywhere.
